## Lessons Learned

- I FINALLY stopped procrastinating and deployed on Netlify. I now feel REALLY stupid as a result of that.
- Got some basic animations down on a website for once. I always knew that they existed... but yet... I never knew when to use them.

At the end of the day, there's quite a decent amount of fixes that can be done... but I'll come back to them SOME day.


## Future TODO

- Incorporate definitions (the one issue being is that a LOT of words would get filtered out)
- Style the site a bit more
- Make the site RESPONSIVE (I can possibly try and use a typography library or something)
